# Salesforce.com Mobile SDK for iOS

You have arrived at the source repository for the Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS.  Welcome!  Starting with our 2.0 release, there are now three ways you can choose to work with the Mobile SDK:

- If you'd like to work with the source code of the SDK itself, you've come to the right place!  You can browse sample app source code and debug down through the layers to get a feel for how everything works under the covers.  Read on for instructions on how to get started with the SDK in your development environment.
- If you're just eager to start developing your own new application, the quickest way is to use our npm binary distribution package, called [forceios](https://npmjs.org/package/forceios), which is hosted on [npmjs.org](https://npmjs.org/).  Getting started is as simple as installing the npm package and launching your template app.  You'll find more details on the forceios package page.

Installation (do this first - really)
==
Working with this repository requires working with git.  Any workflow that leaves you with a functioning git clone of this repository should set you up for success.  Downloading the ZIP file from GitHub, on the other hand, is likely to put you at a dead end.

## Setting up the repo
First, clone the repo:

- Open the Terminal App
- `cd` to the parent directory where the repo directory will live
- `git clone https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS.git`

After cloning the repo:

- `cd SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS`
- `./install.sh`

This script pulls the submodule dependencies from GitHub, to finalize setup of the workspace.  You can then work with the Mobile SDK by opening `SalesforceMobileSDK.xcworkspace` from Xcode.

See [build.md](build.md) for information on generating binary distributions and app templates.

The Salesforce Mobile SDK for iOS requires iOS 10.0 or greater.  The install.sh script checks for this, and aborts if the configured SDK version is incorrect.  Building from the command line has been tested using ant 1.8.  Older versions might work, but we recommend using the latest version of ant.

If you have problems building any of the projects, take a look at the online [FAQ](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-iOS/wiki/FAQ) for troubleshooting tips.

Introduction
==

### What's New in 6.0

**OS Version Support**
- iOS 11 is fully supported in Mobile SDK 6.0.
- The minimum iOS version we support has been bumped up from iOS 9 to iOS 10.

**IDE Support**
- Xcode 9 is the minimum version of Xcode required by Mobile SDK 6.0.

**Library Upgrades**
- We've updated React Native to version 0.50.4.
- We've updated Cordova to version 4.5.4.

**Login Enhancements**
- In version 6.0, Mobile SDK enhances its authentication handling by adding identity provider services.
- Identity providers help known users avoid reentering their Salesforce credentials every time they log in to a Mobile SDK app.
- A Mobile SDK app can be used to provide authentication services to other Mobile SDK apps.
- We have created a template that can be used with `forcedroid` that demonstrates this functionality. This template can be found [here](https://github.com/forcedotcom/SalesforceMobileSDK-AuthTemplates).

**SmartStore Enhancements**
- Mobile SDK 6.0 introduces the ability to define your SmartStore schemas through configuration files rather than code.
- To define soups for the default global store, provide a file named `globalstore.json`.
- To define soups for the default user store, provide a file named `userstore.json`.

**SmartSync Enhancements**
- Beginning in Mobile SDK 6.0, you can define sync configuration files and assign names to sync configurations.
- You can use sync names to run, edit, or delete a saved sync operation.
- You can define “sync down” and “sync up” operations through configuration files rather than code.
- To define sync operations for the default global store, provide a file named `globalsyncs.json`.
- To define sync operations for the default user store, provide a file named `usersyncs.json`.

**Mobile SDK Developer Tools**
- The Developer Support dialog box is the launchpad for all available support screens and other useful actions.
- The dialog box presents only the options that are pertinent to the type of app you’re running.
- During debugging on a desktop, you can access the home screen through a keyboard shortcut or gesture (`^⌘z` keyboard shortcut or `Shake Gesture` in the `Hardware` menu).
- By default, these tools are available only in debug builds. However, you can use an API call to enable or disable the Developer Support screen at other times.

**SDK Manager Classes**
- The `SalesforceSDKManager` class welcomes several new SDK manager cousins that handle specific types of apps.
- This architecture now matches the analogous architecture in Mobile SDK for Android.

**Other Technical Improvements**
- Improvements to sample apps.
- Various bug fixes.

**Deprecations**
- `SFAuthenticationManager` and all its delegates are now deprecated and will be removed in Mobile SDK 7.0. Instead, use `SFUserAccountManager` for authentication related functionality.

### Native Applications
The Salesforce Mobile SDK provides the essential libraries for quickly building native mobile apps that interact with the Salesforce cloud platform. The OAuth2 library abstracts away the complexity of securely storing the refresh token or fetching a new session ID when it expires. The SDK also provides Objective-C wrappers for the Salesforce REST API, making it easy to retrieve and manipulate data.

### Hybrid Applications
HTML5 is quickly emerging as a powerful technology for developing cross-platform mobile applications. While developers can create sophisticated apps with HTML5 and JavaScript alone, some vital limitations remain, specifically: session management and universal access to native device functionality like the camera, calendar and address book. The Salesforce Mobile Container (based on the industry-leading PhoneGap implementation) makes it possible to embed HTML5 apps stored on the device or delivered via Visualforce inside a thin native container, producing a hybrid application.

### Application Templates
The Mobile SDK provides the means to generate your new app from a template, to quickly construct the foundation of native and hybrid applications.  These apps come with a fully functioning demo app, as well as configurable Settings bundles that allow the user to log out of the app or switch between Production and Sandbox orgs.  See [build.md](build.md) for more information on how to generate and use the templates.

**Native App Template**
For native apps that need to access the Salesforce REST API, create your app using the native template.  The template includes a default AppDelegate implementation that you can customize to perform any app-specific interaction.

**Hybrid App Template**
To create hybrid apps that use the Salesforce REST API or access Visualforce pages, create your app using the hybrid app template. By providing the SalesforceOAuthPlugin for our PhoneGap-based container, HTML5 applications can quickly leverage OAuth tokens directly from JavaScript calls.  In addition, our SFSmartStorePlugin will allow you to store your app data securely on the device.
